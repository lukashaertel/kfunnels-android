I wish to encourage everyone who has the desire to at least try and you will find out that no artistic craft is too hard or scary if you have the will. Experience will come with time.

Here you shall find the freshest water and most energizing beverages, to allay your thirst after travelling far through this desert's heat. God Shu, ruler of Wind and Air, sends an eternal breeze of fresh air, to cool the foreworn and freshen thy heavy coat. Should your anthropomorphic manifestation require repair care, the priests will serve you well and offer you our humble tools and materials to help you recover to your greatest form.\r\nMay the furry gods forgive us, but despite all effort, we humble priests can only provide so much space and material of the creature-drying device. We fail to accommodate for all of the over 1000 creature gods staying with us this time. We humbly ask your greatness to remove your fursuit from the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\nTake note: This Oasis is reserved to anthropomorphic beings only. Fursuiters, as you humans may call them. Mere non-furry mortals may not enter these sacred halls.\r\n\r\nTo make the Fursuiter's stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n1. Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n2. Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n3. The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n4. Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n5. Please refrain from bringing glass cups or glass bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n6. Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nOpening times: \r\nThe Fursuit-Lounge is located near the main stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. The Lounge will be locked a night. \r\nIt is open every convention day from 09:00 to 02:00 the next day, or whenever in the morning the last event of the day ends. On Sunday after the convention, please remove all your costumes from the fursuit dryers by noon, as we are going to break everything down in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nFursuit-Support will provide some lounge service on early arrival day, and throughout the deaddog party. Please understand that we canâ€™t provide the full service on these extra days.",

Using digital tools has the advantage, that you can try out different designs and - like in digital drawing - you can just undo mistakes.\r\n \r\nIn this planel you will learn how to transform a character-sheet into a digital 3D model, use this 3D model to define seams and to finally create the sewing pattern for your plushie.

Here you shall find the freshest water and most energizing beverages, to allay your thirst after travelling far through this desert's heat. God Shu, ruler of Wind and Air, sends an eternal breeze of fresh air, to cool the foreworn and freshen thy heavy coat. Should your anthropomorphic manifestation require repair care, the priests will serve you well and offer you our humble tools and materials to help you recover to your greatest form.\r\nMay the furry gods forgive us, but despite all effort, we humble priests can only provide so much space and material of the creature-drying device. We fail to accommodate for all of the over 1000 creature gods staying with us this time. We humbly ask your greatness to remove your fursuit from the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\nTake note: This Oasis is reserved to anthropomorphic beings only. Fursuiters, as you humans may call them. Mere non-furry mortals may not enter these sacred halls.\r\n\r\nTo make the Fursuiter's stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n1. Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n2. Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n3. The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n4. Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n5. Please refrain from bringing glass cups or glass bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n6. Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nOpening times: \r\nThe Fursuit-Lounge is located near the main stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. The Lounge will be locked a night. \r\nIt is open every convention day from 09:00 to 02:00 the next day, or whenever in the morning the last event of the day ends. On Sunday after the convention, please remove all your costumes from the fursuit dryers by noon, as we are going to break everything down in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nFursuit-Support will provide some lounge service on early arrival day, and throughout the deaddog party. Please understand that we canâ€™t provide the full service on these extra days.",

Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

No burnouts - Once again, offenders will be asked to leave.\r\n3.

No wheel/tyre markings to be left on the road surface.\r\n5. No unnecessary noise - i.e. keep stereo equipment to tolerable levels, and no lengthy revving of engines.\r\n6. If you wish to look closer inside someone's vehicle, ask the owner. Do not just open the door and get in.\r\n\r\nMost of all, stay safe and enjoy the event!\r\nPlease check the conbook for details!

The signs and instructions we will learn will hold the sound piece together and will guide you through the musical journey.

Here you shall find the freshest water and most energizing beverages, to allay your thirst after travelling far through this desert's heat. God Shu, ruler of Wind and Air, sends an eternal breeze of fresh air, to cool the foreworn and freshen thy heavy coat. Should your anthropomorphic manifestation require repair care, the priests will serve you well and offer you our humble tools and materials to help you recover to your greatest form.\r\nMay the furry gods forgive us, but despite all effort, we humble priests can only provide so much space and material of the creature-drying device. We fail to accommodate for all of the over 1000 creature gods staying with us this time. We humbly ask your greatness to remove your fursuit from the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\nTake note: This Oasis is reserved to anthropomorphic beings only. Fursuiters, as you humans may call them. Mere non-furry mortals may not enter these sacred halls.\r\n\r\nTo make the Fursuiter's stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n1. Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n2. Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n3. The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n4. Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n5. Please refrain from bringing glass cups or glass bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n6. Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nOpening times: \r\nThe Fursuit-Lounge is located near the main stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. The Lounge will be locked a night. \r\nIt is open every convention day from 09:00 to 02:00 the next day, or whenever in the morning the last event of the day ends. On Sunday after the convention, please remove all your costumes from the fursuit dryers by noon, as we are going to break everything down in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nFursuit-Support will provide some lounge service on early arrival day, and throughout the deaddog party. Please understand that we canâ€™t provide the full service on these extra days.",

Here you shall find the freshest water and most energizing beverages, to allay your thirst after travelling far through this desert's heat. God Shu, ruler of Wind and Air, sends an eternal breeze of fresh air, to cool the foreworn and freshen thy heavy coat. Should your anthropomorphic manifestation require repair care, the priests will serve you well and offer you our humble tools and materials to help you recover to your greatest form.\r\nMay the furry gods forgive us, but despite all effort, we humble priests can only provide so much space and material of the creature-drying device. We fail to accommodate for all of the over 1000 creature gods staying with us this time. We humbly ask your greatness to remove your fursuit from the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\nTake note: This Oasis is reserved to anthropomorphic beings only. Fursuiters, as you humans may call them. Mere non-furry mortals may not enter these sacred halls.\r\n\r\nTo make the Fursuiter's stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n1. Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n2. Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n3. The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n4. Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n5. Please refrain from bringing glass cups or glass bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n6. Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nOpening times: \r\nThe Fursuit-Lounge is located near the main stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. The Lounge will be locked a night. \r\nIt is open every convention day from 09:00 to 02:00 the next day, or whenever in the morning the last event of the day ends. On Sunday after the convention, please remove all your costumes from the fursuit dryers by noon, as we are going to break everything down in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nFursuit-Support will provide some lounge service on early arrival day, and throughout the deaddog party. Please understand that we canâ€™t provide the full service on these extra days.",

I'll do some European anthro comics history, talk about comics theory and abstraction, and hopefully have a nice chat with the attendees about how their characters figure in, and what having a fursona can mean in a person's life.

Here you shall find the freshest water and most energizing beverages, to allay your thirst after travelling far through this desert's heat. God Shu, ruler of Wind and Air, sends an eternal breeze of fresh air, to cool the foreworn and freshen thy heavy coat. Should your anthropomorphic manifestation require repair care, the priests will serve you well and offer you our humble tools and materials to help you recover to your greatest form.\r\nMay the furry gods forgive us, but despite all effort, we humble priests can only provide so much space and material of the creature-drying device. We fail to accommodate for all of the over 1000 creature gods staying with us this time. We humbly ask your greatness to remove your fursuit from the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\nTake note: This Oasis is reserved to anthropomorphic beings only. Fursuiters, as you humans may call them. Mere non-furry mortals may not enter these sacred halls.\r\n\r\nTo make the Fursuiter's stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n1. Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n2. Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n3. The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n4. Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n5. Please refrain from bringing glass cups or glass bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n6. Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nOpening times: \r\nThe Fursuit-Lounge is located near the main stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. The Lounge will be locked a night. \r\nIt is open every convention day from 09:00 to 02:00 the next day, or whenever in the morning the last event of the day ends. On Sunday after the convention, please remove all your costumes from the fursuit dryers by noon, as we are going to break everything down in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nFursuit-Support will provide some lounge service on early arrival day, and throughout the deaddog party. Please understand that we canâ€™t provide the full service on these extra days.",

    "Description": "This panel will be about linear perspective. Linear perspective creates the illusion of three-dimensional depth and distance by assuming that groups of pararell lines go straight into special points called vanishing points. This makes the drawn objects seem smaller as they appear closer to these vanishing points, thus making objects look like they were seen by the observer's eyes. This is an old technique and has been used for centuries, especially since the Renaissance. Many artists however, not only furry artist, have huge problems creating proper three-dimensional illusions. They simply do not understand or do not even know the basics of linear perspective. The basics are easy and can be explained by middle-school mathematics. \r\nIn this panel, the basics of perspective, types of linear perspective, examples, common mistakes and limits will be explained. Tricks will be shown to create regular pararell divisions or replications of objects in perspective, use in scenery, characters and relationship between characters and scenery in perspective (may include basics of composition). You will be presented a way to make more rays (helping, mostly imaginery pararell lines going to vanishing points), when there is no way to draw vanishing points. All backed and explained by science only using pencils and pieces of paper.\r\n\r\n",

We will discuss drawing different body shapes, muscle and fat distribution as well as a quick way to make sure Your art is proportional and will look well when finished. Mind You, anatomy can be tricky - even a properly drawn body may need some modifications in shape in order to make it look more real or better.\r\nI will also cover information about how to join human and animal anatomy in different ways, to make it more interesting and challenging.\r\nIn the end of the panel I plan to organize a quick Q&A section.\r\nFor people interested in my skills in anatomy, I encourage to check out my website (18+): http://www.furaffinity.net/user/furlana/",
